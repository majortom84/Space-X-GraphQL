# Space-X-GraphQL

# Backend Developer Track

Summary: I used vanilla PHP because setting up with a framework would have taken much longer, due to the rules frameworks impose. I had to flatten the array with a custom function in order to setup the data for the output files. This was my first time using GraphQL, I liked it. It was different but, with a little testing and patience I was able to integrate the syntax into a PHP cURL.
